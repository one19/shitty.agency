# [SHITTY.AGENCY](https://one19.github.io/shitty.agency/)

### Purpose:

This is a silly little website. It pokes a bit of fun at the company that gave me my start, and is also a bit of a memorial. I loved this place and its people, and will always have a tender place in my heart for it.
This website is also a small technical project for me to practice my React/CSS/HTML skills in a pared-down environment.

I fully intend to blast this website on a semi-regular basis, but it should only ever be a showcase for frontend builds.

### Git Flow:

Deploys stick in master, develop is for pre-deploy, and all new branches will create PRs into it.

### Deploy instructions:

`npm run build` generates assets into the `/docs` folder that **gh-pages** then reads in the `master` branch. Pull requests are always welcome if you'd like to add anything!
